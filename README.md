# JJEFDOMGridmaker



    Goal:

    To deepen your understanding of the DOM and how it interacts with HTML, JavsScript, CSS, and user events.

    Requirements:
        75% - Assignment Functionality
        25% - GitHub Workflow (Follow the 8 steps in Week 2.2, slide 8)

    Assignment:

    For each user story, create one (or more) feature branch(s), develop your changes, open a PR and merge your changes based on feedback.

    Based on the in-class presentation, complete the following user stories:
        As a user, I can click a button to add a row to the grid
        As a user, I can click a button to add a column to the grid
        As a user, I can click a button to remove a row from the grid
        As a user, I can click a button to remove a column from the grid
        As a user, I can select a color from a dropdown menu of colors
        As a user, I can click any cell and change its color to the one selected in the dropdown menu
        As a user, I can click a button to color all cells with the color selected in the dropdown menu
        As a user, I can click a button to color all uncolored cells with the color selected in the dropdown menu
        As a user, I can click a button to remove the color from all cells

    Bonus stories - Up to 15% extra credit
        (2%) As a user, I want my buttons to be well-styled, contained neatly within divs, and centered on the screen
        (6%) As a user, I cant to select a color from a color wheel, that will show the RGB or Hex value of the color I selected
        (7%) As a user, I want to be able to toggle between two modes: (1) clicking a cell to change its color (default) and (2) clicking a cell to change its color and fill all contiguously similar cells, connected by up/down/left/right borders 
        (2%) As a user, I don't want my grid to expand endlessly off of the screen, either horizontally or vertically.

    Recommended: Reference the Document documentatiion, as there are plenty of methods and properties that will help with this assignment (i.e. getElementbyId(), getElementsByTagName(), querySelector(), etc) and the Element documentation for similarly useful capabilities (i.e. click)
    Github:
    This is a group assignment. Each team should create a repo and make all of their code changes using the feature branch workflow. They should deploy their changes to GitHub Pages and submit a link to the page. Only one person from each team needs to submit the link to their site.
    Generally, you should be reviewing >2x as many PRs as you're opening. You should have a working knowledge of the whole codebase, even if you didn't write it all.
